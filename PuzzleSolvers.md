# Puzzle Solvers
### By Anna Hickerson

As I encounter various puzzles, I prefer to find a systematic method for solving a puzzle rather than working through many examples.  It is also interesting practice for me to learn a new language or syntax.

## sudoku.R

R code to solve a given sudoku puzzle.  The puzzle must be initialized in the code, not a file. Doesn't really work yet.

## text_wordle.py

Text-based python code to emulate Wordle.
